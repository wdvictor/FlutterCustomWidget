# Flutter Custom Widget (Not Released yet)

  

Install custom widgets commonly used in flutter apps with a single command line.

This project is used by me to learn bash, and came with a very handly ideia: Install custom widgets that I use in flutter projects with a single command line rather than find the code, copy and past.

  
  

# How to use

  

$ fluttercw -i [widget_name]

Example:

  

$ fluttercw -i extensions

  

&ensp;  &ensp;  &ensp;  &ensp; Will create a folder called extension in the /lib folder and create a file called extensions.dart with a lot very handy extensions to use in dart code.

&ensp;  &ensp;  &ensp;  &ensp;

  
  
  

# Commands

  

- -i --install [widget name]

&ensp;  &ensp; Install [widget name] in /lib folder. Some widgets will create diferent name folders such as **widgets** or **extentions**
