# Flutter Custom Widget

  

  

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; Install custom widgets commonly used in flutter apps with a single command line.<br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; This project is used by me to learn bash, and came with a convenient idea: Install custom widgets that I use in flutter projects with a single command line rather than find the code, copy, and past.<br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; Are we developers right? Do repetitive tasks are against our `code` (pa-tum-tis)

  
# Installation

    $ ./install.sh
 
 

# How to use

  
Usage: 
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;  fluttercw \<command> [arguments]

    $ fluttercw -i [widget_name]
 
Example:

     $ fluttercw -i extensions

&ensp;  &ensp;  &ensp;  &ensp; Will create a folder called extension in the /lib folder and create a file called extensions.dart with a lot very handy extensions to use in dart code.
