# Flutter Custom Widget (Not Released yet)

  

  

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; Install custom widgets commonly used in flutter apps with a single command line.
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; This project is used by me to learn bash, and came with a convenient idea: Install custom widgets that I use in flutter projects with a single command line rather than find the code, copy, and past.
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; We are programer rigth? Do repetitive tasks are against our *code* (pa-tum-tis)
